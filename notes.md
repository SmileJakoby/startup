# Github notes
Here are my personal notes for github. I've used Github Desktop for a time now, and am familiar with repositories, cloning, branches, and forks. However, I have seldom used console commands myself so I have written them down here.

## git add {filename}
Puts {file} into stage

## git commit -am "{string}"
Commits all staged files, with {string} as the commit message.

## git push
Pushes all committed files to the origin (the server)

## git pull
Pulls all files from the origin (the server) to your machine.

## git diff --name-only --staged
Shows the names of all changed files in the stage.
